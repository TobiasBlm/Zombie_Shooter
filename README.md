# Zombie_Shooter
School project

This is a school project me and two of my friends did, it's an ego shooter with a basic GUI, where you can select the desired level. It also stores highscores locally in a SQL format.

Level 1-3 and 3-6 are different worlds and on higher number more zombies spawn.
You can download the Unity project (version 2021.3.22f1)

# How to play
Until now I haven't found a way to upload the game and the Unity Project in GitHub and it's the simplest way to share them via Google Drive Link. "Build0507" is a playable version of the game and "InformatikProjekt03_07" the Unity project.

The C# scripts of the project are uploaded in the Folder Scripts here in GitHub
